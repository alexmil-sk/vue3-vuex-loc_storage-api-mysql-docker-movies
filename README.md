<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created for the educational purpose of developing a full-stack application that uses a MySQL database to store data about the user's movies, which communicates with the frontend using REST API requests.

The application consists of backend & frontend parts.
The backend part is created using Node.js .
The frontend part was created using VueJS & Vuex.
The first is that a custom movie catalog is created using MySQL. It is possible to add movies, edit and delete from the user directory.
The second is that the existing movie catalog is downloaded from the mock service. For this catalog, it is possible to download a range of movies, delete them and add them to favorites.

Additionally, a directory of employee contacts has been created. Employee data was downloaded from the mock service. A separate card containing complete information has been created for each employee.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation for GitHub version

1. Download the code fron GitHub or clone the repo.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alexmil-sk/vue3-vuex-loc_storage-api-mysql-docker-movies
   ```

2. Install NPM packages Backend & Frontend

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Run MySQL service on your computer (backend).

4. Run Backend from the backend folder with the command:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Run Frontend from the frontend folder with the same command:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Installation for DockerHub version without downloading

1. You don't need to download the project code from GitHub.

2. You only need to take the docker-compose.pub.yml file from the project folder on GitHub.

3. To start the project in the terminal, you need to type the command:

   ```sh
   $>docker-compose -f docker-compose.pub.yml up
   ```

4. To access the MySQL database administration zone using Adminer, you must use a password, located in docker-compose.yml file in the section:

   ```js

  backend:
  environment:
  MYSQL_USER: root
  MYSQL_PASSWORD: password

   ```

### Installation for Docker Local version (to be able to edit application on your computer)
